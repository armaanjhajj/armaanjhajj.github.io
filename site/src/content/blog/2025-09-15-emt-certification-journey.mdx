In May 2025, I started EMT training at RWJ Barnabas. I wanted to combine my academic path in pre-med with real clinical, on-the-ground experience.

The training wasn’t just about memorizing protocols — it was about learning to stay calm in chaos, practicing psychomotor skills like CPR, childbirth, and airway management, and understanding how to document patient care effectively.

This blog will cover:

- The foundational modules (airway, trauma, patient assessment).
- Preparing for the psychomotor and written exams.
- Balancing EMT shifts, research, and startup work.

I’m working toward becoming a certified EMT — and this journey has given me a new respect for frontline responders.
