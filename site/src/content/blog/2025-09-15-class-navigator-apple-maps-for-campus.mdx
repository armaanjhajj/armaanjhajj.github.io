This one’s still just an idea: an app that helps students find their classes on campus the way Apple Maps helps you find a restaurant.

Too often, students (especially freshmen) wander aimlessly trying to find the right building or lecture hall. Class Navigator would:

- Let students input their schedule.
- Show step-by-step walking directions between classes.
- Highlight time-to-class to reduce late arrivals.

It’s still conceptual, but it’s the kind of problem I’d love to solve — simple, real, and helpful.
