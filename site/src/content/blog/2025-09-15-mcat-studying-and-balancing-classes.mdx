The MCAT isn’t just another test — it’s a marathon. I built a 15-week study plan in Notion, color-coded by subject (Chem/Phys, CARS, Bio/Biochem, Psych/Soc).

At the same time, I’ve been taking courses in Computer Science, Data Science, and Chemistry while completing EMT training. It hasn’t been easy, but building systems and structure has kept me afloat.

This post breaks down:

- How I structured daily/weekly study blocks.
- The resources I used (books, practice tests, flashcards).
- The mental side: staying consistent even while juggling startups, research, and EMT shifts.
