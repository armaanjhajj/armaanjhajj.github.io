I didn’t start out as a developer. But building Moments forced me to learn — fast.

What I’ve picked up so far:

- Frontend: React, TailwindCSS, responsive design, Liquid Glass UI principles.
- Backend: Supabase (auth, database, RLS), Twilio (SMS), Vercel (deployments).
- Product design: Branding systems, UX wireframes, onboarding flows.

Moments has been the best crash course in full-stack development + product building. And the best part? Seeing people actually use what you’ve built.
