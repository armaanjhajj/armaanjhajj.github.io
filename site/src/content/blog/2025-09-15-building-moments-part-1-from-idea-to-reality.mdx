I’ve always been fascinated by the small moments when people almost connect — sitting next to someone in class, walking past someone in the library, waiting in line for coffee. Most of those interactions go nowhere. They’re missed connections.

That’s where Moments began: a simple idea to fix what’s broken in how we connect. Dating apps felt transactional. Social media felt performative. What was missing was authentic, real-world, face-to-face interaction.

This post kicks off a series documenting the journey of building Moments from the ground up — branding, team building, UI/UX, Supabase + React stack, marketing campaigns, and the upcoming Rutgers Fall 2025 launch.
