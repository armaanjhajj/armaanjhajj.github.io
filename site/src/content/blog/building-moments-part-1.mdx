Moments started from a simple observation: the best connections happen offline.

This series documents how I’m shaping the brand, designing the product, and preparing a campus launch for Fall 2025.

## Why real‑world first

Digital feeds optimize for attention, not belonging. Moments flips the script by nudging people toward serendipity in the real world.

## Early decisions

- Focus on one campus, one community.
- Design for small, meaningful interactions.
- Keep the brand warm, clear, and human.

More soon — including design explorations and onboarding flows.
