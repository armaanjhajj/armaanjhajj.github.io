One of my favorite side projects is reimagining the classic diner jukebox. The idea: a coin-operated Raspberry Pi system that integrates with Spotify/Apple Music, letting customers pay to queue songs.

Why? Because physical interactions with music are missing today. The jukebox project is about nostalgia + modern tech: combining retro diner vibes with digital streaming.

This post will cover:

- The hardware schematic (coin acceptor + Pi + audio output).
- Software integration with streaming APIs.
- Thoughts on pricing strategy (balancing novelty with affordability).
