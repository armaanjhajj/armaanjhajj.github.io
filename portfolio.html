      <h2>tech</h2>
      
      <p>i know how to code.</p>
      
      <p>i've built many websites, not just for myself but <strong>businesses in my area (on commission)</strong>, for my own business, <strong><a href="https://havemoments.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moments</a></strong>. I was the <strong>lead front-end developer for our app (Moments)</strong> and have experience with <strong>React, Expo, Next.js, and Node.js</strong>. countless classes and hours of LeetCode practice in <strong>Java</strong>. conceptually, it's my favorite OOP-based language for problem solving and whatnot. i've had little professional or technical application using Java, but i definitely have the skill set to learn more and build that expertise.</p>
      
      <p>i have the ability to implement <strong>technical solutions to legacy systems</strong> in businesses. worked as a <strong>consultant privately to outpatient medical practices</strong> like a pediatric office and civil surgeon office to shift fully paper-based back offices to online health records and labs with <strong>OfficeAlly and Epic systems</strong>. i've also helped local businesses replace their legacy punch card systems and similar things with <strong>online loyalty tracking systems</strong> via simple websites, Supabase/Firebase backends, and very fast and efficient solutions. every client i've had has been very pleased with the product i've built them and have even referred me to peers to offer similar services.</p>

      <h2>medicine</h2>
      
      <p>i have been an <strong>MA (Medical Assistant)</strong>, <strong>EMR (Emergency Medical Responder)</strong>, and <strong>EMT (Emergency Medical Technician)</strong>.</p>
      
      <p><strong>as a Medical Assistant</strong> at private practices, i was in charge of acting as a liaison between the patient and doctor. as patients entered, i simply prepped them for their visit by taking preliminary vitals including weight, height, hearing, and vision tests, and making sure the doctor or PA on shift received all pertinent information before meeting with them. as an MA, i was also in charge of most if not all office manager roles. i had to retrieve patient labs and prep back for visiting patients and prep new visit sheets, create new patient files for new patients, acquire all insurance information from patients for billing, and contact insurance companies to ensure active plans when entering information to our billing platform. i was in charge of issuing/charging visit co-pays and even <strong>billing ICD-10 codes from doctors' visitation notes</strong>. i would then send all collected samples out to lab/testing companies like <strong>LabCorp and Quest</strong>. i was finally in charge of upkeeping all other office responsibilities like cleaning and taking out trash.</p>
      
      <p><strong>as an EMR (Emergency Medical Responder)</strong> at OnTime Ambulance in Roselle, NJ:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Patient care:</strong> Administering CPR, controlling bleeding, stabilizing injuries, and providing basic first aid and oxygen therapy</li>
        <li><strong>Scene assessment:</strong> Evaluating the safety of the emergency scene, protecting patients from further harm, and summoning appropriate assistance</li>
        <li><strong>Patient stabilization:</strong> Providing immediate care to keep a patient stable until paramedics or EMTs arrive</li>
        <li><strong>Transport:</strong> Transporting patients to facilities or assisting with their transport from the scene</li>
        <li><strong>Assistance:</strong> Helping higher-level medical staff, such as EMTs and paramedics, with their duties</li>
        <li><strong>Equipment and vehicle maintenance:</strong> Ensuring emergency equipment is ready and performing vehicle checks, cleaning, and fueling if the role involves driving an ambulance</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>i acquired my <strong>EMT licensure from Robert Wood Johnson Barnabas</strong> and now am <strong>EMT certified and licensed in the state of New Jersey</strong>.</p>

      <h2>creative</h2>
      
      <p>i have always been an aspiring <strong><a href="videos.html">video editor</a></strong> and have done countless projects in video editing. <strong>Adobe Premiere Pro</strong>. i've edited videos for personal projects with friends for vlog-style videos and memorabilia but also for orgs on campus such as <strong>MSA and SSA</strong> for promotional content and even my own business. almost every social media post for <strong><a href="https://havemoments.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moments</a></strong> has been directed, edited, and even filmed/shot by me.</p>
      
      <p>i have an equally strong passion for <strong><a href="photography.html">photography and photo editing</a></strong>. i've spent a bunch of time and a questionable amount of money on a starter camera (<strong>Sony a6000</strong>) and a few lenses taking photos and editing them on <strong>Adobe Lightroom</strong>. I can safely say i have a lot of time and experience using the <strong>Adobe Suite</strong>.</p>
