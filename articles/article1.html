  <h1>Entry 1: Debugging My Very Wrong Guesses</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">A walk through three C problems that taught me how to stop worrying and love the segfault.</p>

  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/f4a25771-e6a7-406e-90bc-ccecc49629d9.png" alt="Code Debugging Vibes">

  <p>I have been procrastinating. I kept telling myself I’d start documenting my progress as a software engineer, but every time I opened my editor, I ended up doing literally anything else.</p>

  <p>So here's how I got forced into it — with an assignment from my computer architecture class. We had to complete three programming problems in C, each testing a different concept: string parsing, sorting structs, and assignment-based data aggregation.</p>

  <p>Let’s walk through them.</p>

  <h2>Problem 1 – Weighted Student Grades</h2>
  <p>We had to read weights from a file and calculate weighted averages for 20 students. Here's the basic idea:</p>

  <pre><code>while ((c = fgetc(file)) != '\t' && c != EOF) {
  name[i++] = c;
}
name[i] = 0;</code></pre>

  <p>This little loop reads the student’s name until it hits a tab character. Took me a while to realize how fragile tab-delimited parsing can be. One wrong keystroke in the input file and you're printing garbage.</p>

  <h2>Problem 2 – Sorting Students by GPA</h2>
  <p>Next we had to sort 100 students by GPA using <code>qsort</code>. This was surprisingly painless once I wrote the comparison function:</p>

  <pre><code>int compare(const void *a, const void *b) {
  const struct Student *x = a;
  const struct Student *y = b;
  return (y->gpa > x->gpa) - (y->gpa < x->gpa);
}</code></pre>

  <p>Yeah, I didn’t know you could do that either — that return line basically subtracts two boolean expressions to sort descending. Beautifully cursed.</p>

  <h2>Problem 3 – Class Statistics</h2>
  <p>This one was a beast. The assignment codes (P, A, Z, etc.) could come in any order, and we had to track min, max, and average for each category. I learned real fast that mixing up indices was a one-way ticket to junk output.</p>

  <pre><code>printf("ASSIGNMENT: %s\n", fullName(codes[j]));
printf("MIN: %d\n", min);
printf("MAX: %d\n", max);
printf("AVG: %.1f\n\n", avg);</code></pre>

  <p>All that after storing grades in a 2D array and keeping careful track of totals across nested loops. Shoutout to whoever invented for-loops. Real ones.</p>

  <div class="signoff">
    I'm slowly realizing that being a good software engineer isn't about knowing all the answers — it's about knowing how to debug your very wrong guesses.
    <br><br>
    These three problems taught me:
    <ul>
      <li>Think step-by-step, especially when parsing or looping.</li>
      <li>Keep your input files clean and consistent.</li>
      <li>Don’t fear GDB — it’s a flashlight in the dark.</li>
    </ul>
    Anyway. This is Entry 1. Hopefully not the last.
    <br>
    Back to procrastinating.
