      My name’s Armaan. I’m a student at Rutgers University pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science and Chemistry with a concentration in Data Science. I’ve always been drawn to both healthcare and technology (blame it on the fact that my dad’s an engineer and my mom’s a doctor), and I’m planning to go into medicine. I’m especially fascinated by the growing space where these fields meet and hope to contribute to tech-driven solutions that make modern healthcare more efficient, accessible, and honestly—better.

      Outside of school (and work), you’ll usually find me lifting at the gym, out on a run, hanging with friends, or folding and caving into a late-night Valorant match. If you asked my friends to tell you one stupid thing about me, they’d probably mention how my Spotify Wrapped ends up clocking in at like half a million minutes because I’m basically always listening to music.

      I’d love to name a few of my favorite artists—but I can’t narrow it down. So here’s whoever I’ve been obsessed with lately:Drake (obviously), Tame Impala, Radiohead, Ken Carson / Carti / Lone, Beach House, Charli XCX, Kaytranada, PinkPantheress, Cocteau Twins, Arctic Monkeys, Lorde, Malcolm Todd, Mk.gee, Frank Ocean, Daniel Caesar, Berlioz, Jeff Buckley, Clairo… oops got carried away lol.

      I also have a habit of picking up hobbies like it’s a personality trait. Just this year alone, I’ve cycled through guitar, photography, basketball (religiously), sewing and messing around with clothes, archive fashion, journaling (yes, with one of those overpriced leather ones), drawing, hiking, running, and—dude—even crocheting. I don’t know either.

      Anyway, as cliché as it sounds, I’m just some brown kid from Brampton who moved around a bunch before landing in Edison, NJ (basically the Brampton of the U.S.). Along the way, I found some stuff I thought could use changing—and now I’m just trying to leave my mark on the world, one way or another.
